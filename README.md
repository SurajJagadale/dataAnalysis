# Data Analysis for Sale Dataset

This repository contains the code and data for analyzing a sale dataset using Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains information about sales transactions. It includes various attributes such as 'User_ID', 'Cust_name', 'Product_ID', 'Gender', 'Age Group', 'Age',
'Marital_Status', 'State', 'Zone', 'Occupation', 'Product_Category','Orders' and 'Amount'.

## Files

- `Diwali Sales Data.csv`: CSV file containing the raw data.
- `data_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Libraries Used

- **NumPy**: Used for numerical computing and array operations.
- **Pandas**: Utilized for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Employed for creating visualizations such as line plots, histograms, and scatter plots.
- **Seaborn**: Used for statistical data visualization, enhancing the visual aesthetics of Matplotlib plots.

## Analysis Steps

1. Data Loading: Load the dataset using Pandas.
2. Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, data cleaning, and data transformation if needed.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
4. Data Visualization: Create visualizations to gain insights into the data distribution, trends, and relationships.
5. Statistical Analysis: Perform statistical tests or calculations to extract meaningful information from the data.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `data_analysis.ipynb`.
4. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the notebook to run the analysis.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides insights into the sales dataset, helping to understand the trends, patterns, and factors influencing sales. It can be further extended or modified for specific business needs or deeper analysis.
